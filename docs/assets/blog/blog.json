    "content": "<p>Apple quietly made the iPhone 16 Pro one of the first mainstream Wi-Fi 7 devices. With its new 320 MHz channel support, the phone can hit multi-gigabit speeds and enjoy lower latency for AirDrop, streaming, and gaming. But unless you upgrade your router, you won’t feel any of those benefits. This post explains exactly why your new iPhone deserves a Wi-Fi 7 router.</p>",
