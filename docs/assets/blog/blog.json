    "content": "<p>iPhone 17 / 17 Pro / 17 Pro Max bring Wi-Fi 7 with 320 MHz channels and Multi-Link Operation. That means faster AirDrop, quicker iCloud backups, and lower-lag streaming—if your router supports Wi-Fi 7 on 6 GHz. Still on Wi-Fi 5/6? Your phone falls back and you lose the benefits. This post shows why upgrading the router unlocks your new iPhone’s speed, what specs to buy (320 MHz, MLO, 2.5G+ ports), and how to set it up right.</p>",
