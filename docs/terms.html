        <h2>Quick Summary (not a substitute for the full Terms)</h2>
        <ul class="bullets">
          <li>RouterHaus provides informational tools and recommendations; we are not your ISP or equipment seller.</li>

      </section>

      <section id="disputes">
        <h2>12) Disputes: Arbitration & Class-Action Waiver</h2>
        <p><strong>Binding arbitration.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court. <strong>No class or representative actions or arbitrations.</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Forum & rules</strong>: Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules. If AAA is unavailable, another neutral administrator will be selected by agreement or by a court.</li>
          <li><strong>Venue & law</strong>: Phoenix, Arizona (or remote video where allowed). Arizona law governs (without regard to conflict-of-laws rules), except that the Federal Arbitration Act governs interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement.</li>
          <li><strong>Small-claims & IP</strong>: Either party may bring an individual action in small-claims court or seek injunctive relief for intellectual-property misuse in a court of competent jurisdiction.</li>
          <li><strong>Costs</strong>: Payment of filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by AAA rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Opt-out</strong>: You may opt out of arbitration within <strong>30 days</strong> of first accepting these Terms by emailing <a href="mailto:legal@routerhaus.com">legal@routerhaus.com</a> with subject “Arbitration Opt-Out” and your name and the email you used with us.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>13) Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time with or without notice if we believe you violated these Terms or for any reason. You may stop using the Services at any time. Sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., IP, disclaimers, liability limits, indemnity, disputes) will survive termination.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="third-party">
        <h2>14) Third-Party Sites & Services</h2>
        <p>Links to third-party sites are provided for convenience. We do not control or endorse them and are not responsible for their content, policies, or practices.</p>
